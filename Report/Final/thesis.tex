%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,

MPLS is a transport protocol used mostly by Internet service providers and its very popular due to its fast switching at the layer 2.5 header and various traffic engineering features offered by it. Organisations which spread across geographies widely use MPLS to get connect every branches together and to get single office experience. As a service which offered by Service Provider and the Service Provider is a public channel, Security and Privacy is always a concern of MPLS. Generally ISP cannot guarantee any extended security to the traffic flows because if they implement any technique to secure the data, it will affect their promised SLAs because all the Security mechanisms will have its overhead and it will affect the performance of the Network. Hence Security is always compromised over SLAs and Network Performance. In this Dissertation, I have listed various security requirements, Security threats of MPLS and few available tools to protect MPLS. Even though there are tools and technologies available to Secure the MPLS Network, there is no single solution for MPLS Security. We have to implement a mixture of features according to the users requirements. I have listed the issues of the available Security features and Introduced a New means to protect MPLS, called Opportunistic Security in MPLS. In this project, I have explained the design, Implementation and result of Opportunistic Security in MPLS in the form of a proof of concept.
