\chapter{Conclusion}


Nowadays most of the Global Organisations highly rely on MPLS for connecting offices in different campuses and geographies. Interoffice connectivity mostly done by ISPs and its a public network. Mostly Service provider will not take the responsibility of any data security since it will affect their SLAs and they will recommend the customers to take care of the data security. As of today there is no one single solution which can protect all the aspects of MPLS Security and MPLS Opportunistic Security is a comprehensive solution to solve most of the vulnerabilities of MPLS Security. MPLS Opportunistic Security can be used as end to end solution or Hope by Hope and I highly recommend to use MPLS Opportunistic Security as a end to end solution because Hope by Hope is highly secure but the overhead created will be severe. Encryption and Decryption of packets create overhead in the network, but the trade of is between Security and and slight performance degradation. From the experiment and study I performed, I could see that if we use MPLS Opportunistic Security as a end to end solution where only PE routers participate in Key management and packet encryption/decryption, then overhead in the performance will be negligible but the gain is overall MPLS Security\cite{smith01}.
